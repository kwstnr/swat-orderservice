== Introduction
This Repository contains the Java Project "orderservice" which is used for the module "Software Architecture and Techniques" at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences.
It contains the "orderservice" which was developed during the module "Software Development and Architecture" and is used as a refactoring project in SWAT.
The goal is to increase code quality, stability, maintainability and many other aspects of an existing codebase and adopt inputs given during the lectures.

== System Context
The orderservice represents a single microservice which was used within a bigger system. The System was a "Filialverwaltung" where a shop could manage their shops at different locations, their warehouses including the articles and orders made by customers.
This service handles the creation and maintainement of orders. It is able to create, validate and annulate orders.
It subscribes to RabbitMQ Queues on to which the other services can publish messages and gives responses to requested response queues.
The data is persisted using a MongoDb Database.

== API
=== Create Order
A order can be created by pushing a message to the queue `order.post` with a `CreateOrderDto` containing all the information needed for the order.
The created order is then returned to the queue, which is spessified in the message properties.

It will create an order of state "Bestellt" and will send verify messages to other services to verify articles and users that are part of the order.

=== Annulate Order
A order can be annulated by pushing a message to the queue `order.delete` with a `DeleteOrderDto` containing all the information needed for the order to be annulated.
The order will be set to the state "Annuliert"

=== Get Order
Orders can be fetched by pushing Messages to the queues `order.get` or `order.getAll`

== Verification of Orders
Articles and users of an order are verified asynchronously by sending messages to other services. Their responses determine if a property can be verified or not.
If all properties of an order are verified, the order will reach the state "Bestätigt" and bill and confirmations are sent to other services.

== Architecture Design Records
Architecture design decisions can be documented using the following template and appended to this chapter.
